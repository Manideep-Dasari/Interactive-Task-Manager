# Interactive Task Manager

## Project Description
The Interactive Task Manager is a responsive web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize daily tasks efficiently. The application supports adding, editing, deleting, completing, and reordering tasks, with persistent storage using the browser’s localStorage. The UI is designed to be clean, accessible, and user-friendly, following modern web design principles.

## Code Structure Explanation
- **index.html:** Defines the structure of the application using semantic HTML elements
- **style.css:** Handles layout, spacing, responsiveness, and UI styling
- **theme.css:** Manages light and dark theme variables
- **app.js:** Core application logic (CRUD operations, filters, events)
- **ui.js:** Handles DOM rendering and UI updates
- **storage.js:** Manages saving, loading, backup, and restore of tasks
- **utils.js:** Utility functions such as unique ID generation

---

## Technical Requirements Implementation
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamic task rendering and updates
- **Event Handling:** Form submission, clicks, keyboard shortcuts, drag & drop
- **Array Methods:** map, filter, splice, find for task management
- **localStorage:** Persistent storage for tasks
- **Form Validation:** Prevents empty or invalid task entries
- **Dynamic Updates:** UI updates without page reload
- **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
